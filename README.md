dot-files
=========

Various dot files for quickly setting up a new box.

### .bash_rc ###
Settings for bash. This may need to be appended to an existing .bash_rc file instead of dropped in. On some
machines it may be necessary to add `source ~/.bash_rc` to the .bashprofile file as well.

### .gitconfig ###
Settings for git.
