dot-files
=========

Various dot files for quickly setting up a new box.

### .bashrc ###
Settings for bash. This may need to be appended to an existing .bashrc file instead of dropped in. On some
machines it may be necessary to add `source ~/.bashrc` to the .bash_profile file as well.

### .inputrc ###
Adds a more seamless history search. Pulled from here: https://coderwall.com/p/oqtj8w

### .gitconfig ###
Settings for git.
